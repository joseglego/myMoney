# myMoney
An application to manage the personal finance and take care about the incomes, outcomes, liquid money and credit cards.

## UX strategy

As the short description states, myMoney is all about managing personal finances and analyzing that data to improve the user's financial health. This is tackled through 4 main aproaches: tracking, financial statements, automation and goals.

### Tracking (T)

Where it all starts, this area includes all posible regular inputs by the user: income, expense or liability. Every time one of those is performed, the user enters it and the program guides him/her to classify it and store it, thus keeping a record of every financial movement made.

### Financial statemets (FS)

According to the kind of data introduced though *Tracking* (income, expeses and liabilities) and other inputs provided directly through the screens related to FS (assets), the program will be able to produce the following financial statements:
* Balance sheet
* Income statement
	* Detailed income entries
	* Detailed expenses

### Automation (A)

This provides the user with the posibility to set reminders for singular tasks (e.g.: single payment for a random service) or regular payments (e.g.: monthly credit card payment).

### Goals (G)

The game to achieve financial health. This module offers:
* Information on financial health through the display of financial ratios.
* Statistics on tracking habits.
* Set financial goals and show the progress towards them (future versions).
* Financial literacy according to the user needs (future versions).

The idea is to reward the user (a.k.a. player) whenever he/she shows progress:
* Building the habit to track all financial movements.
* Showing progress towards the goals.
